# Flask RESTful API  summary notes
# REST stands for representational state transfer
# Itâ€™s an architectural style for designing standards between computers,
#  making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.
#  In simpler terms, REST is a set of rules developers follow when they create APIs.
#  A system is called RESTful when it adheres to these constraints.
#  To understand the term rest we need to understand the terms Client and a Resource
# Client - A client can refer to either a developer or software application which uses the API. 
#  When you are implementing the Google Maps API in your application, you are accessing resources 
# via the API, which makes you a client.Similarly, a web browser can also be a client.
# A resource describes an object, data, or piece of information that you may need to store or send to other services.

# characteristics of rest systems
# 1. Client- server  there should be a separation betweeb the server that offers the 
# serivece and the clients that consumes the service
# 2. Stateless  - the server cannot store information provided by the client in on erequest and use in another request
# 3. Cacheable - the server must indicate to the client if the request can be cached or not
# 4. Layered system - communication between the client and the server should be standardised in such a way that it allowes intermediaries to respond to
# instead of the end server, without the client having to do anythong different
# Uniform Interface - the method of communication between the client and the server must be uniform
# code on demand - servers can provide executable code or script for clients to execute in their context
# 
# 
# HTTP request methods and their actions 

# GET -	Obtain information about a resource Example:	http://example.com/api/orders
# (retrieve order list)
# GET -	Obtain information about a resource Example:	http://example.com/api/orders/123
# (retrieve order #123)
# POST -	Create a new resource Example:	http://example.com/api/orders
# (create a new order, from data provided with the request)
# PUT-	Update a resource Example:	http://example.com/api/orders/123
# (update order #123, from data provided with the request)
# DELETE-	Delete a resource	EXample: http://example.com/api/orders/123
# (delete order #123)

#  API - this stands for an application programming Interface
#  An API is a mode of communication between two software application example The google maps API 
#  An API is just a medium that lets two entities of code talk to each other.


# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based data storage format that is designed to be easy to read for both humans and machines.
#  JSON is generally the most common format for returning data through an API, XML being the second most common.
#  Flask provides us with a jsonify function that allows us to convert lists and dictionaries to JSON format.
